Have been using Gemnini to help vibe code parts of this but trying to hook up a firebase DB and Google cloud repository for the card graphics just destroyed the working app - have had to revert back to the basic UI and lost about 7 hours of my life going in circles with Gemini trying to link the DB and storage. I would not recommend Firebase studio or Gemini for any complex coding work - basic UI it handled OK, wasn't great and would make really basic mistakes and then not fix it when I highlighted what it had done but go off on tangents giving me "best practice" solutions that didn't work.
